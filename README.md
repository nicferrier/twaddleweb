# twaddle - a simple, in page, twitter client

Simply download these files, put them on a webserver and load
twaddle.html from there.

twaddle needs twitter's basic authentication.
It may [never support OAuth](http://www.countdowntooauth.com/ "count down to oauth")
and so might die 

If you like twaddle do please send comments to me via github.
